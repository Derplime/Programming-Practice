Most of these modules were just used during the early stages of our Senior Design project to familiarize myself with the MERN stack and designing the backend server files and API.

Some files are outdated, but they were kept the way they were for use in the lessons.

As a result most, if not all of the modules, are currently incomplete. I may touch base on them at some point, but I'm more active on my Udemy courses at the moment.
